    <p>This made it's own page because it's the most important lesson. Failure itself is it's most important lesson. That's all there is to it. Not a step back, but a step forward to a better direction because you learned what not to do.</p>
    <p>Don't ever take this lesson for granted, and don't ever take yourself for granted either.</p>
