  <h1>Classes and IDs</h1>

<p>Say we have a notification to style, with an id of <code id="notification">notification</code>.<p>

<div>
  This has an <strong>id</strong> of <code id="notification">notification</code>, so it is selected in CSS with <code>#notification</code>. Check it out.
</div>

<p>But what if we have many messages on the page which are meant to look similar?</p>

<div>
  This is in an element with a <strong>class</strong> of <code class="message">message</code>, so it can be selected in CSS with <code class="message">.message</code>.
</div>

<div>
  This is in another element with a <strong>class</strong> of <code class="message">message</code>, so it gets styled too.
</div>

<div>
  A third element with a <strong>class</strong> of <code class="message">message</code>, for good measure. One CSS selector styles all of these.
</div>

<h2>IDs are singular, Classes are plural</h2>

<p>An ID is meant to be used only once in a given HTML document. A given element can have only one ID.</p>

<p>A class can be reused as many times as needed in a given HTML document. A given element can have multiple classes.</p>

<p>This will probably be the <strong>most confusing</strong> thing you do in your life, <strong>ever</strong>!</p>

<h2>Using Multiple Classes</h2>

<p>An element can be given multiple classes, separated by spaces, such as <code>class="foo bar baz"</code>.</p>

<div>
  This has <code class="message error">class="message error"</code>, meaning it has two classes: <code class="message">message</code> and <code class="error">error</code>. It will get styles from <code class="message">.message</code> and <code class="error">.error</code>. The styles for <code class="error">.error</code> override the default styles, which we achieve by placing them after the styles for <code class="message">.message</code>.
</div>

<h2>Your Turn</h2>

<p>Add a new element to the page below the error message, that will serve as a success message, and style it to be green.</p>

<p>This is a <code class="message error">"message error"</code>. For instance we can give this class to the word <code class="message error">"DANGER"</code>!!!!

<p> You're asking me to style a <code class="message error">"message error"</code> in <span>GREEN</span>... Not really ideal because people will not associate that as being a <code class="message error">"message error"</code> but i guess we can do it just this once... <code class="message error green">"message error"</code>.</p>
